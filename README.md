# Introduction

As we are really busy with our day-to-day life, almost everyone is like to have their meal wherever and whenever they want. So, online food delivery services are really famous and very popular among people. There are so many food delivery services in Sri Lanka and there are huge beneficiaries also. We are providing some extra service for those delivery services such that they can improve their security issues which must be solved before it becomes a disadvantage for such great service.

# Current Problem 
There are services which are providing online food delivery service already but, there are some serious issues regarding those services. The main thing is about security (Reliability/Trust). In this particular situation those questions 'How much we can trust those services? as customers' and 'How much we can trust those services? as restaurant owners' can be occurred. There are two major roles in here. First one is the restaurant owners who provide food through delivery services and the second one is the customer who orders food through delivery service (Website or Mobile App). 
We saw some complaints and some news about 'not delivering the ordered food accordingly' and also complaints about 'not having food with great quality' from customers. Also, we could see that restaurant owners could not do anything about that as delivery service provides the service of delivery. But they have the issue about their customer's trust. This becomes a problem in a good service and we want to give a solution that would help to develop the online food delivery service.

# Solution
As it becomes a real-world problem, we thought about having a solution. Basically, we provide a locking system for the food container which can only be accessible from two ends. The person from restaurant side providing food can unlock the container using a RFID card and put the order into it. After locking the container, it can only be unlocked by the customer using an OTP or a RFID card or both. That must satisfy customers as it cannot be opened within delivery. So, they can trust about whatever they buy.
